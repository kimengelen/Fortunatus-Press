# Fortunatus-Press
Fortunatus-Press is a small and independent organization wit a protean nature, focusing on Contemporary art. Fortunatus-Press is not about profit but about building on schemes of reciprocityâ€”rather than traits of opportunistic tendencies. She shows international working artists within the context of creative collaborative inquiry. Her artists are mostly working in interdisciplinary fields, as well as working in practices that defy easy definitions.  In her current book-series 6 ArtISTS, the concept is simple: In 6 months, 6 artists will get 6 questions. This book-series project will run for 6 years. Via these interviews, we can read what goes on in the minds of some of these super incredible awesome inspiring and smart contemporary artists. With this support, the book project could run longer. And become more professional. With the funding, we could have our books printed.
